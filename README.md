#### Overview
In a dynamic technology landscape, there is a sweet spot in implementation, deployment, and operations which constantly needs to be found.  Although models, implementations, and paradigms evolve and grow, there is still a perspective and approach to technology which allows groups to leverage technology to accomplish that group's goals.  I look for that sweet spot, and work to deliver that to the group I'm working with.

#### Summary
I am a seasoned veteran in the delivery, implementation, and management of infrastructure and technologies. As the industry has evolved, so have my points of focus: hardware, software, networks, systems, on-prem, cloud, propietary, open source, and others.  I am seeking an impact role with heavy emphasis on strategic planning and execution of tasks and projects in implementing and supporting technologies, and close synergistic working relationships with colleagues. Great people form great teams, and I'd like to join one.  Our work is already fun and interesting, but it can also be deeply rewarding.
